Mission:

- publish a simple idea through a gist - instead of the entire code which used to produce it.

Need
=
- accomplish the process of publishing an idea
- I want a publish gist - tagged with a version number - which is easy to update accross multiple machines.


Problem:
=
- heavy lifted code doesn't catch

Next:
=
- remove .git cached files

###Solution:
=
- nevermind the tools used to produce the actual script:
- the script should be minimize to its bones 
- leave the code used to produce the script behind


###Standards:
- a neat script should have tags:
- lines_count: MOST IMPORTANT FOR A SCRIPT IF HE WANT TO BE FAMOUS 
- version: integer
- date:    last update
- author:  myself + add link to original snippet
- presentation: link to a webpage which describe the script / present it: video/image
- test:         a travis output/test
- help:    installation steps
- options: command line arguments
- installation: describe the commands - which scrap itself - for clarify its requirments
