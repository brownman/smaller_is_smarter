Need
=
- accomplish the process of publishing an idea
- I want a publish gist - tagged with a version number - which is easy to update accross multiple machines.


Problem:
=
- heavy lifted code doesn't catch



###Solution:

- nevermind the tools used to produce the actual script:
- the script should be minimize to its bones 
- leave the code used to produce the script behind


###Standards:

- date:    last update
- author:  myself + add link to original snippet
- presentation: link to a webpage which describe the script / present it: video/image
- test:         a travis output/test
- help:    installation steps
- options: command line arguments
